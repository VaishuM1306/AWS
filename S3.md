# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)<br>

- AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud based storage service that allows you to store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data like files, images, videos, and backups securely and at scale. <br>
- It provides highly reliable, scalable object storage, making your data accessible from anywhere, anytime, via the internet.<br>
- Store data as objects<br>
- Globally unique name<br>
-Region specific<br>
- Each object within a bucket is stored as a key-value pair <br>
-key is the object’s name (which can contain slashes /, mimicking directory structure)  <br>
- value is the content of the object (the file/data itself).<br>
- Maximum Object Size:<br>
      5 TB (Terabytes) is the maximum size for a single object in Amazon S3.<br>
- Multipart upload is recommended for objects<br>
larger than 5 GB (split the file into smaller parts and upload them separately).<br>


## S3 is used in many different scenarios. For example:<br>
**Web Hosting**: S3 can be used to host static websites by storing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.<br>
**Data Lake**: S3 is commonly used as a data lake, a centralrepository where you can store both structured andunstructured data for analytics.<br>
**Backups and Disaster Recovery**: Because of its durability anddifferent storage classes, S3 is a popular choice for storingbackups and long-term archives."<br>

## S3 Versioning <br>
- It allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket, providing protection against accidental deletions or overwrites. <br>
- When versioning is enabled, S3 stores every version of an object, allowing you to recover older versions if needed, making it ideal for data safety and backup.<br>

##  S3 Replication <br>
- It allows you to automatically copy objects from one S3 bucket to another, which can be  within the same region (Same-Region Replication - SRR) or in different regions (Cross-Region Replication - CRR). <br>
- It's commonly used for compliance, redundancy, and to improve data access performance by maintaining copiescloser to your users.<br>

  ## S3 Bucket Policies<br> 
- JSON-based access control policies that you attach directly to an S3 bucket to manage permissions for accessing the bucket and its objects.<br> 
- They allow you to define who can access the data and what actions they can perform, such as read, write, or delete, enabling fine-grained control over the security of your data stored in S3<br>

  ## S3 Storage Classes<br>
# S3 Storage Classes – Short Notes Table

| Storage Class | Short Description | Key Points |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **S3 Standard** | Frequent access | High performance, Multi-AZ, Default class |
| **Standard-IA** | Infrequent access | Cheaper than Standard, Retrieval cost, Multi-AZ |
| **One Zone-IA** | Infrequent + Single AZ | Lowest cost in IA, Not for critical data |
| **Intelligent-Tiering** | Auto tiering | Moves data automatically, Best for unknown access |
| **Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Archive + instant | Low cost, Millisecond retrieval |
| **Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Archive (minutes–hours) | Very cheap, Long-term storage |
| **Glacier Deep Archive** | Lowest cost archive | 12-hour retrieval, Compliance data |



# S3 Bucket Lifecycle
- You can use lifecycle policies to control the movement of objects between different storage classes or delete them entirely, based on specific conditions like age or inactivity.<br>
- There are two main types of actions that you can define in a lifecycle policy:<br>

**There are two main types of actions that you can define in a lifecycle policy:**<br>
**Transition Actions**:<br>
-This action is used to move objects to a different storage class. You can move objects to cheaper storage classes as they age and are less frequently accessed. <br>
  **For instance**
- Move objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) after 30 days.<br>
- Move objects from S3 Standard-IA to S3 Glacier after 90 days.<br>
- Move objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term retention after a specific period.<br>


**Expiration Actions**: <br>
- This action is used to delete objects after a specified period.<br>
- You can set rules to permanently delete objects when they are no longer needed,<br><br><br>
**such as**:<br>
   - Delete objects after 365 days.<br>
   - Delete old versions of objects (when versioning is enabled) after acertain period.<br>
 
### S3 Snow Family<br>
- The S3 Snow Family is a group of physical devices offered by AWS to help move large amounts of data to the cloud when using the internet isn’t practical. <br>
- These devices are used when there's too much data to upload over a regular connection or when dealing with remote areas without goodinternet.<br>
- The Snow Family includes:<br>
AWS Snowcone: A small, portable device for a few terabytes of
data.

**AWS Snowball**: A larger device for moving petabytes of data and can also be used for edge computing.<br>
**AWS Snowmobile**: A massive truck-sized container used for exabyte-scale data transfers, typically used by big companies moving entire data centers.<br>

### Amazon S3 Storage Gateway<br><br>
- It is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments to cloud storage in AmazonS3. <br>
- It helps extend your local storage to the cloud byacting as a bridge. <br><br>

Advantages of Amazon S3 (In Short, With Example)
✅ 1️⃣ Scalable

You can store unlimited data without managing disks.
Example: A video app stores millions of user-uploaded videos without worrying about storage limits.

✅ 2️⃣ Highly Durable

Data is safely replicated across multiple data centers.
Example: Even if one data center fails, your backup files are not lost.

✅ 3️⃣ Cost-Effective

You pay only for what you use and can move old data to cheaper storage (like archive tiers).
Example: Old project backups automatically move to low-cost Glacier storage.

✅ 4️⃣ Secure

Supports encryption and access control (IAM policies).
Example: Only authorized employees can access company reports stored in S3.

✅ 5️⃣ Easy Web Access

Accessible via internet (HTTP/HTTPS).
Example: A website stores images in S3 and delivers them to users worldwide.
