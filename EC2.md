# EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing )<br>
•	Amazon EC2 is a core AWS service that provides virtual servers (instances) on demand. <br>
•	It eliminates the need to invest in physical hardware — you can provision compute capacity in minutes.<br> 
•	It’s called “elas c” because resources can scale up or down based on demand. <br>


# Instance Types 
###  Definition: Defines the hardware configuraƟon of an instance (CPU, RAM, storage, networking).
**  Families of Instance Types: **
1. General Purpose → Balanced CPU + memory (e.g., t2, t3, m5).<br>
2. Compute Optimized → High CPU performance (e.g., c5)<br>.
3. Memory Optimized → For RAM-heavy workloads (e.g., r5, x1).<br>
4. Storage Optimized → For high disk throughput (e.g., i3, d2).<br> 
5. Accelerated CompuƟng → GPU, FPGA for ML/AI (e.g., p3, g4).<br><br><br>

# EC2 Purchase Plans (Short)

1. **On-Demand** – Pay per use, no commitment, expensive.  <br> 
2. **Reserved Instances (RI)** – 1/3 year commitment, cheaper, steady workloads.<br> 
3. **Savings Plans** – Commit $/hour, flexible, up to 66% discount.  <br> 
4. **Spot Instances** – Use unused capacity, very cheap, can be terminated anytime.  <br> 
5. **Dedicated Hosts** – Entire server for you, expensive, compliance/BYOL.  <br> 
6. **Dedicated Instances** – Isolated hardware, cheaper than hosts, compliance workloads. <br>  
7. **Capacity Reservations** – Reserve capacity in AZ, no long-term commitment.<br>
