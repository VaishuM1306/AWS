#EC2 (Elastic Cloud Computing )<br>
•	Amazon EC2 is a core AWS service that provides virtual servers (instances) on demand. <br>
•	It eliminates the need to invest in physical hardware — you can provision compute capacity in minutes.<br> 
•	It’s called “elas c” because resources can scale up or down based on demand. <br>


# Instance Types 
###  Definition: Defines the hardware configuraƟon of an instance (CPU, RAM, storage, networking).
**  Families of Instance Types: **
1. General Purpose → Balanced CPU + memory (e.g., t2, t3, m5).
2. Compute Optimized → High CPU performance (e.g., c5).
3. Memory Optimized → For RAM-heavy workloads (e.g., r5, x1).
4. Storage Optimized → For high disk throughput (e.g., i3, d2). 
5. Accelerated CompuƟng → GPU, FPGA for ML/AI (e.g., p3, g4).
